## Introduction
The **ANN Image Recognition Project** is designed to classify images using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize and categorize images into predefined classes. It serves as a foundation for computer vision applications such as object detection, facial recognition, and automated tagging.

## Project Objective
The objectives of this project include:
- Developing an ANN-based model to classify images with high accuracy.
- Utilizing datasets to train and test the model efficiently.
- Providing a simple interface for users to upload and classify images.
- Implementing visualization tools to interpret model performance.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Recognizes and categorizes images into classes.
- **Pretrained Models**: Uses transfer learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Upload an image and get instant classification results.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple UI for non-technical users.
- **API Support**: RESTful API for integrating image recognition into applications.

## Data Sources
- Open-source image datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet)
- Custom datasets uploaded by users for training
- Preprocessed datasets from Kaggle and other research sources

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Frameworks**: Flask / FastAPI (for API development)
- **Database**: SQLite / PostgreSQL (for storing metadata)
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Plotly

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ann_image_recognition.git
   cd ann_image_recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download and prepare the dataset.
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Upload an image**: Drag and drop an image for classification.
- **View predictions**: See the predicted class and confidence score.
- **Model evaluation**: Check accuracy, loss, and other performance metrics.
- **API Access**: Use the provided API to integrate classification in other applications.

## Model Training
To train the ANN model on a dataset:
1. Ensure the dataset is properly structured.
2. Modify `config.py` to adjust training parameters.
3. Run the training script:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model and save it for deployment.
